# Multi-Style Configurable UI Components With Tailwind CSS

This is the workshop app repo. **You don't need to clone it and set it up locally**, as we'll be doing all the challenges in [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io).

The "companion" website for this website is located at https://multi-style-components.protailwind.com. Each challenge in that website has a Gitpod link to the relevant branch and file for a given challenge.

If you choose to use this repo, you must know that each challenge is located in a different branch.

### Focus groups & breakout rooms

You'll be split in small focus groups for today's workshop challenges. This consists of separate "breakout rooms", where each member of the group will take turns "driving" a challenge by sharing their screen.

The groups will remain the same for the entire workshop.

At the end of challenges, we'll all come back together to discuss. "Pairing" in small groups and actively participating to group discusions are key to this workshop. They'll help you maximise your learning experience.

I really encourage everyone to participate actively, ask questions, and of course be supportive of one another!

### Aaaand... who am I?

I'm Simon, your workshop instructor. ðŸ‘‹

If you've watched some YouTube videos from the Tailwind Labs channel, you've most probably seen my face already!

I love utility-first CSS. I've been supporting and promoting this styling approach even before Tailwind CSS existed! I'm a front-end developer, designer and content creator.

I bring a lot of enthusiasm and positive energy in everything I do, this is just how I'm wired up!

I have been teaching in-person workshops for multiple senior engineering teams, and a constant piece of feedback I get is my workshops are exciting, fun and engaging. To me, that's the best way to learn!

I sometimes speak at conferences and meetups. I make YouTube videos and I'm also an instructor on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

You can connect with me on Twitter, I'm [simonswiss](https://twitter.com/simonswiss) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­

I'm super excited to dive into this workshop with you.
